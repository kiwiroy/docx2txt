v0.1 : 10/08/2008

Initial Sourceforge release with attempts to handle following features during
text extraction.
- horizontal ruler, line breaks, paragraphs separation, tabs
- naive nested list formatting - assumed 8 level nesting, however if you want
  to deal with further nesting, play comment-uncomment in perl script. :)
- capitalisation of text blocks i.e. in document.xml text is stored either as
  lowercase or in mixed case, but in corresponding text files generated by
  MSOffice it comes as all caps.
- character conversions (" ' < & > - ... etc.). Euro character is converted to
  E, however you can change this behaviour by comment-uncomment in perl script.
