1. Handle footnotes.
2. Handle lists in better way.
3. Create a simple manpage, hopefully after resolving footnote and list issues.
4. Explore what can be done to make installation less involving for the user.
5. XML parsing??? and making things more efficient. When it has matured enough,
   may be a C/C++ version should be looked into.
6. Number of configuration variables are increasing. High time to have a
   configuration file so that user doesn't have to edit the script to adjust
   these settings.
7. Extract images. Now there has been a user request as well.
8. Improve table and short line justification handling. Ideally table columns
   in a single row should be separated by pipe. Short line justification needs
   to be adjusted to situations when tab occurs in line. A quick look into these
   issues suggests that logic/code will need to be reorganised to handle these.
9. Implement simple state-machine for speedup [partially worked towards it].
