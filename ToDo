1. Handle footnotes.
2. Handle lists in better way.
3. Create a simple manpage, hopefully after resolving footnote and list issues.
4. Explore what can be done to make installation less involving for the user.
5. XML parsing??? and making things more efficient. When it has matured enough,
   may be a C/C++ version should be looked into.
