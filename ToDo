1. Shift some logic from shell script to perl script, so that standalone perl
   script can also be used to extract text from docx files.
2. Use unzip in better way and simplify shell script.
3. Handle footnotes.
4. Handle lists in better way.
5. XML parsing??? and making things more efficient. When it has matured enough,
   may be a C/C++ version should be looked into.

Atleast 1 and 2 should be handled in a week since v0.1 release. Reasonable
progress has already been made on 1,2 and 4.

Current release has been pending since almost two weeks. There is no end to
improvements. :)
