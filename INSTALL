1. Adjust various executables and installation directory paths for your system.
   - #! paths for bash and perl in docx2txt.sh and docx2txt.pl
   - paths for unzip, sed and rm in docx2txt.sh
   - install directory, and paths for cp and chmod in Makefile

2. Adjust RMFLAGS in docx2txt.sh to suite your patience. :)
3. Run 'make install' as root.
