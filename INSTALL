You will need make and install utilities installed on your system for
installation via makefile.

Adjust various executables paths before proceeding for installation.
- #! path for env in docx2txt.sh and docx2txt.pl
- path for unzip in docx2txt.pl


Linux, Cygwin, BSD and similar systems
--------------------------------------

Type "make" as root to install docx2txt scripts for all users in /usr/local/bin.
If you want to install these in some other directory, you can do so via

make INSTALLDIR=/path/to/desired/directory

BSD users can use either GNU make or BSD make.


Windows
-------

You can install Cygwin from http://www.cygwin.com/ and follow the instructions
given in the corresponding section above.

If you do not want to install cygwin, you can give following a try and give
your feedback about it.

a. Get following files (earlier available in /usr/bin/ of cygwin installation)
   and place them in, say C:\docx2txt .

   cygwin1.dll
   perl.exe
   cygperl*.dll
   unzip.exe
   cygcrypt*.dll

   If you find something more was needed, please inform me so that I can update
   this documentation.

b. Copy docx2txt.pl also to C:\docx2txt .

c. Change path for unzip in docx2txt.pl to C:/docx2txt/unzip.exe .

d. You should now be able to invoke docx2txt.pl from within C:\docx2txt as
   follows.

   perl docx2txt.pl file.docx
   perl docx2txt.pl directory\file.docx -
   perl docx2txt.pl directory/file.docx file.txt
   perl docx2txt.pl C:/somedir/file.docx
   perl docx2txt.pl C:\somedir\file.docx C:\otherdir\converted.txt

In case you have some perl and commandline unzip utility installed on your
windows system and want help in using docx2txt.pl script there, please feel
free to contact me via project page [http://sourceforge.net/projects/docx2txt].
Remote access to your system will be required in this case.


Manual Installation
-------------------

1. Copy docx2txt.pl and docx2txt.sh to the desired directory.

   cp docx2txt.pl docx2txt.sh /path/to/desired/directory

2. Change the permission of copied files to 755.

   chmod 755 /path/to/desired/directory/docx2txt.*

3. Add the concerned directory to your PATH, if not already in PATH.

   PATH=$PATH:/path/to/desired/directory


Important Notes
---------------

1. You need to have perl installed on your system for using this tool.

2. You can skip installing docx2txt.sh if you want to. This Bash script wrapper
   internally invokes the perl script. It also checks for overwriting the output
   text file apart from usage difference [check README for details].
