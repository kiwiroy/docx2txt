docx2txt is a simple converter from Docx to text format. It works reasonably
well even for v0.1, but it can have bugs. So far it has been been tested with
few resumes and student questions .docx documents.

In case you find some issue or need for a feature that can be handled in docx
text extraction, please feel free to communicate. A small test .docx files
depicting the issue/need and the corresponding text file generated by MSOffice
with character substitution enabled, will be helpful.

You can adjust
- newline,
- list level indentation amount, and
- list element indicator characters for different levels
in docx2txt.pl to suit your formatting taste.

Currently 8 level list nesting is assumed, however if you want to deal with
deeper nesting, you can adjust that as well in the perl script, by following
the comments in the perl script.

This program includes no warranty whatsoever. It is provided "AS IS". For more
information please read the COPYING document, which should be included with the
package, and describes the GNU Public License, which covers docx2txt.
