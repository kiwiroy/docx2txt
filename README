docx2txt (http://docx2txt.sourceforge.net/) is a simple converter from Docx to
Text format. It works reasonably well even for v0.1 .

In case you find some issue or need for a feature that can be handled in docx
text extraction, please feel free to communicate. A small test .docx files
depicting the issue/need and the corresponding text file generated by MSOffice
with character substitution enabled, will be helpful.

You can also track the project via http://sourceforge.net/projects/docx2txt .


How to Use
----------

v0.2 onwards, you can do the text extraction in two ways.

1. Using docx2txt.sh :

   docx2txt.sh file.docx
   OR
   docx2txt.sh file

   In both these cases output text will be saved in file.txt .

2. Using docx2txt.pl :

   docx2txt.pl infile.docx outfile.txt
   OR
   docx2txt.pl file.docx

   In latter case, extracted text will be output on the stdout/terminal.


Tune your Experience
--------------------

You can adjust
- newline,
- list level indentation amount, and
- list element indicator characters for different levels
in docx2txt.pl to suit your formatting taste.

Currently 8 level list nesting is assumed, however if you want to deal with
deeper nesting, you can adjust that as well in the perl script, by following
the comments in the perl script.


Note for MC (Midnight Commander) fans
-------------------------------------

You can add following binding in ~/.mc/bindings and view the text content of
.docx file by hitting F3 function key (assuming default key mappings).

# Microsoft .docx Document
regex/\.(docx|DOCX|Docx)$
	View=%view{ascii} docx2txt.pl %f
